# BaseDCGan
This is a basic deep convolutional gan implementation featuring dropout, label smoothing, batch normalisation and some other improvements. This is a personal anchor point for developing other GANs, but is open for others to fork. As such, there is no guarantee that the code below will work.

The loadDataSets.py is for the conversion of the AADB dataset into a numpy array suitable for processing. For any other dataset this will need to be reconfigured accordingly.
